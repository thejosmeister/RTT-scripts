  <Name>Swindon February 2021</Name>
  <Description>Timetable for a Monday in February 2021.\n\nKnown issues to make this timetable work with sim v4.3.7:\n- Class 387 EMU runs on diesel because the sim has no electrified track (yet).\n- All trains east of Didcot will enter or exit the sim at Reading. Reversing at Reading or switching lines to Basingstoke or Taunton is not possible (yet).\n- Swindon - Kemble causes a few problems because in the sim it&apos;s not a double track line (yet).\n- Some train workings have been adjusted slightly for the ARS in the sim to function properly.\n</Description>
